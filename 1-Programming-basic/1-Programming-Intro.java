/* Types of languages:
-- Procedural, functional, Object-oriented
-- Static and dynamic languages (type checked at compile time vs runtime)

Types of memory:
--stack & heap:
a=10
a --> reference variable, 10 --> object
a --> stack memory, 10 --> heap memory
a is pointing to the object 10 in the heap memory
one object can have more than one reference variables

Garbage collection in java:
-- hits automatically when required to free memory
-- when there is no reference variable pointing towards an object, the object gets deleted during garbage collection
