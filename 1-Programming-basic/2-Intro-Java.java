/* Java Basics

.java file (human readable) --> .class file (byte code)(JVM) --> machine code (0 & 1)
source code --> compiled code --> interpreted code
--this makes java platform independent

-- Java Architecture:
JDK(JRE(JVM(JIT)))

* JDK:
-- a package required to develop, compile, execute java programs
-- contains: dev tools, compiler, runtime, interpreter,etc

* JRE:
-- runtime for java applications
-- contains: deployment tools, jvm, libraries
